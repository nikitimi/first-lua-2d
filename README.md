This uses Love2D game library,
my practice sandbox for developing cross-platform game.

The motivation for using this game library is it uses Lua which I can transfer in ricing my
Linux Distro's NVIM.

The knowledge gain here is also transferrable to Godot, which is my primary game engine of choice.
